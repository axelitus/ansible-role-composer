# Ansible Composer Role

An ansible role to provision Composer PHP Package Manager in a server.

The role is packaged in a way that only the *var files* should be modified to set installation specifics.

To use just copy the contents to the *roles/composer* folder inside your ansible structure and add the role *composer* to the playbook.
